# Disruptions

# COVID-19 Response

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/mask.jpg")
```

--

Take a moment to think back on the disruptions of the past couple of years:

--

- How did you respond? How are you responding?

--

- What help did you need to move forward?

---

# Gaps

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

--

There were gaps in the pandemic response for all of us.

--

Formal, official help wasn't enough.

--

It was up to you to figure out how to fill the gaps.

PLNs are a particular type of **support system**: Meant to improve teaching and learning

# The Study

---

# Purpose

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teacher.jpg")
```

Explore **build-your-own support systems** 

--

that early career teachers construct 

--

during **induction** - the disrupted transition period from preparation to practice

---

# Participants

```{r, out.width = "280px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/teaching.jpg")
```

--

I wanted to understand what early career teachers are doing,

--

so I talked to them (semi-structured interviews):

--

- MSU College of Education Master's degree students (*n* = 9)

--

- 0-3 years experience in teaching

--

- Teaching in U.S. (geographically dispersed)

--

- Distinct backgrounds and experiences: classroom teachers, specialists, itinerants, starting mid-year

# Discussion

---

# Agentic Choices

```{r, out.width = "600", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

--

- Teachers were consistent in making agentic choices for their professional development 

--

- but varied in the specifics of their agentic actions

---

# Agentic Choices

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

- Early career teachers exercised **agency** in filling gaps and navigating tensions

--

- **Purposeful** sense of having a job to do

---

# Agentic Choices

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

- Determination to find the tools, people, and spaces necessary to do that job well

--

- **Purposeful** plan for each social media platform

---

# Agentic Choices

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/self-directed.jpg")
```

- As well as intentionality to sometime choose *not* to pursue (boundaries)

--

- **Purposeful** to maintain personal-professional separation, even more important than potential benefits

# Implications for Early Career Ts

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

### Passion alone is not enough

--

- Build-your-own support systems are necessary

--

- Today there are more available tools, people, and spaces to fill the **gaps**

--

- Many early career teachers likely navigate increased **tensions** related to *context collapse* and *social comparison*

---

# Implications for Ed Leaders

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

### Agency is finite

--

- Meet early career teachers where they are as they try to fill **gaps**:

--

  - Expand notions of what "counts" for professional development to include social media: alleviates some **tensions** around time

--

  - Set up protected spaces for early career teachers and train them to use: alleviates some **tensions** around social comparison

---

# Implications for Researchers

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/puzzle-gap.jpg")
```

### PLNs don't magically appear

--

- Support systems are built with purpose and intention

--

- Researchers must foreground phenomena like identity-agency to really understand PLNs

# Conclusion

# Conclusion

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/support-system-wide.jpg")
```

- Identity-agency helps us better understand responses to **induction** disruptions (and other disruptions)

--

- and move a bit closer to **sustaining**, not just retaining, early career teachers (and other professionals)
