## Abstract

This presentation focuses on identity-agency as a framework to better understand professional learning networks in social media research. The study addressed reasons why early career teachers construct support systems during induction, the skills and resources they seek, from whom, and how they use social media to expand the tools, people, and spaces available to them. Semi-structured interviews with nine early career teachers provided data for exploring how social media create new opportunities and tensions.
